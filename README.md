# Advanced-Machine-Learning-Project

This is the final project for the Advanced Machine Learning course at Politecnico di Torino and it is about **Real-Time Anomaly Segmentation for Road Scenes**.

The group is composed by:
- [Raffaele Pane](https://github.com/bred91) S305485
- [Dimitri Masetta](https://github.com/dimi-it) S306130
- [Ruben Tetamo](https://github.com/rubenw104) S317569

You can find a couple of launchers (Jupiter notebooks) to run the code on Google Colab.

- [EvaluationLauncher](EvaluationLauncher.ipynb) it runs the evaluation of the models on the various test sets. You can find the pretrained models [here](trained_models).
- [TrainingLauncher](TrainingLauncher.ipynb) allows to train the models on the training set. You may want to set che config file [here](training/configs) before running it (there are a set of pre-made configs to semplify the setting of each task).
